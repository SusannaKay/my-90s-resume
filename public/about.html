<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Woof! I'm Carlotta, the dog developer with a nose for bugs and a tail that wags at the sight of clean code. Born and raised
in a cozy doghouse, I swapped chasing my tail for chasing deadlines and debugging.</p>

<h2>My Paw-fessional Journey</h2>
<p>I started my career digging holes in the backyard, but soon found my true calling digging into lines of code. From
fetching sticks to fetching data, I've mastered it all. My favorite programming languages are BarkScript and Paw-thon,
and I‚Äôm known for my dogged determination to solve even the toughest problems.</p>

<h2>Special Skills:</h2>
<p>Full Stack Fetcher: From front-end fetch to back-end bury, I handle it all with ease.
Sniffing Out Bugs: My keen nose can detect even the most elusive bugs hiding in your codebase.
Paws-on Projects: Always ready to lend a paw, I excel at collaborative projects and can work like a dog to meet
deadlines.
Dog-friendly Interfaces: I design interfaces so intuitive that even a puppy could use them.</p>
<h2>Notable Projects:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>WoofPress: A blogging platform for dogs, by dogs.</li>
  <li>BarkBook: A social media site where you can share photos of your favorite hydrants and mailmen.</li>
  <li>Paw-dacity: An audio editing software that translates your barks into human-readable commands.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fun Facts:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I once wrote an entire app with a tennis ball in my mouth.</li>
  <li>My favorite algorithm is "fetch and return".</li>
  <li>I can debug while napping (a skill honed from years of sleeping with one eye open).</li>
</ul>
<h2>When I'm Not Coding:</h2>
<p>You‚Äôll find me at the dog park, networking with other dogvelopers, or at home, perfecting my sit-stay-fetch-deploy
routine. I also enjoy a good belly rub and consider it an essential part of my daily workflow.</p><br>

<p>So, if you‚Äôre looking for a developer with a pawsitive attitude and a penchant for perfection, look no further. I‚Äôm
Carlotta, the dog developer, and I‚Äôm ready to take a bite out of your next big project!</p>

Woof on,<br>
Carlotta üêæ<br>

P.S. I promise not to chew on your cables...much.
